Problem Statement: Develop a machine learning model to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston suburbs based on various socio-economic factors.
Dataset Description: Utilized the Boston Housing dataset, consisting of 13 continuous attributes (features) and 1 binary-valued attribute (CHAS), with the target variable being the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV) in $1000's.

Data Exploration:
Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution, relationships, and correlations between different attributes.
Visualized data using histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices, and heatmaps to identify patterns and insights.

Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values by either dropping data points with missing values, dropping entire attributes, or imputing missing values using the median strategy.
Created new attribute combinations, such as the tax-to-room ratio (TAXRM), to potentially enhance model performance.

Feature Engineering:
Engineered features to capture additional information or relationships within the dataset, aiming to improve predictive modeling.

Model Selection:
Explored and compared different regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression, to identify the most suitable model for the task.

Model Training and Evaluation:
Trained the selected model using the training dataset and evaluated its performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Utilized cross-validation techniques to assess the model's generalization and robustness.

Model Deployment:
Saved the trained model using joblib for future use and deployment in production environments.
Demonstrated how to use the saved model to make predictions on new data, facilitating practical applications of the predictive model.

Results:
Achieved a certain level of accuracy in predicting housing prices, as indicated by the RMSE on the test dataset.
Evaluated and interpreted model performance, identifying areas for potential improvement or optimization.

Future Work:
Suggested potential avenues for further improvement, such as exploring additional features, fine-tuning model hyperparameters, or incorporating more advanced techniques.
